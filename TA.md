# TA @ Le Wagon

Here is a list of guidelines you should follow during your day as Teaching Assistant.

## Rules of the TA Club

During your duty, keep in mind these simple rules:

* Rule #1: Be **prepared**. Do again all the exercises the day before.
* Rule #2: Have a lot of **patience**.
* Rule #3: **Repeat** again, again and again.
* Rule #4: Always be **nice**.
* Rule #5: **DO NOT** take the keyboard (especially on the first 2 weeks).
* Rule #6: **DO NOT** give the solution. First give hints, ask questions, debug with them. Then finally show and explain the solution if nothing else worked.
* Rule #7: Pay attention to **coding style**. It's important they adopt a correct styling within the first weeks.

## It's okay to say `I don't know`

YES, it's okay to say that you don't know everything and that:

* You're alumni of one of the previous batches ;
* You're here to help them but sometimes you may not be able to answer to all their questions ;
* Teachers are here for these kind of tricky questions ;
* You're here because YOU really understand their pain since you've been through the same issues ;
* You'll be the ONE that will explain more easily tricky concepts because you'll use your own words.

Don't underestimate your value in this bootcamp :)
